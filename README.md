# Scheduler

## Todo

- Biking Activity
- Output Lists
- Testing
- List of workshop names

## Questions

- Will the website have to sort the students by grade or will the spreadsheet come sorted?
- Can I rig the website so I will get what I want?
- What format will the lists of kids for each workshop be in?
- Does there need to be more than just A and B workshops (for the future)
- Any more customization?
- Sponsorship

## Reminders

- Each column in the input spreadsheet must be spelled correctly (ParticipantID not Participant ID, Choice1 not Choice 1)
- The input spreadsheet must be in CSV format
- The output schedule will be a .JSON file (how to open in excel)
